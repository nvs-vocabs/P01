**Describe the parameter code you need**
A clear and concise description of the variable description you want to add to the P01 Parameter Usage Vocabulary - provide links to related information (e.g. scientific publication using or describing the concept) if possible

**What would be its expected units of measure or its vector dimensions**
Please use free text or provide a link to a concept from a controlled vocabulary (e.g. use URIs from BODC NVS [P24](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/P24/) or [P06](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/P06/)) collections or [QUDT units](https://www.qudt.org/doc/DOC_VOCAB-UNITS.html))

**What property kind could be used to define the type of measurement this relates to**
Please use free text or provide a link to a concept from a controlled vocabulary (e.g. use URIs from NVS [S06](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/S06/) collection or [QUDT Quantity kinds[(https://www.qudt.org/doc/DOC_VOCAB-QUANTITY-KINDS.html))

**What is the primary object of interest (i.e. a chemical, biological or physical entity)**
