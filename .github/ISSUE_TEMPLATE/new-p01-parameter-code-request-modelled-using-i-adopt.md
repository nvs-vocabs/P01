**What would be its expected unit of measure or its vector dimensions**
Please use free text or provide a link to a concept from a controlled vocabulary (e.g. use URIs from BODC NVS P24 or P06 collections or QUDT units)

**What property term could be used to define the type of measurement this relates to**
Please use free text or provide a link to a concept from a controlled vocabulary (e.g. use URIs from NVS S06 collection or QUDT Quantity kinds)

**What is the primary object of interest (i.e. a chemical, biological or physical entity)**
Please use free text or provide a link to a concept from a controlled vocabulary (e.g. from NVS S26, S27, S18/S29, or S25 collections or from EnvO or other resources)

**Would we need to define a matrix? If so what should the matrix be?**
